**Educational Application on iOS Development with SwiftUI and MVVM**

This application has been built for educational purposes to demonstrate the process of developing an iOS app using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and the SwiftUI framework. To enhance the experience, we have integrated the public API from [RandomUser.me](https://randomuser.me) to load fictitious user data.
